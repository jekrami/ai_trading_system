# Portfolio Allocation Rationale

The current portfolio allocation is designed to:

- Maximize risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)
- Diversify across different asset types
- Overweight assets showing stronger momentum
- Maintain limited exposure to highly correlated assets

This allocation aims to balance growth potential with downside protection.
